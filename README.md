## Design Pattern Review
During the development of the quiz app, we consider that, the best Design pattern that we can use is the Model View Template, here are the reasons:

- The Model will be in charge of the management of the questions, answers and users.
- The View will be the interface in which the user data is presented, here will be shown the questions and the answers will be collected.
- The Template will manage the events, like the choosing of answers or the presentation of the next question.

## Feedback 
As a group, we consider that we did a great work as a team.
